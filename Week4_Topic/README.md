# **Week 4**

## **Task 1** Side channel attacks

Choose an example of a side-channel attack and explain the following information about it:

-Brief explanation of what side-channel the attack uses and how
-What systems does it affect?
-What information is leaked via the side channel?
-is there a documented case of it being used in a real life attack?
-Has it been fixed? If yes, how it was fixed?


List sources and keep the answer consice at max 300 words

## **Task 2** Slow Loris

*Virtual Linux recommended for this exercise*

A Denial of Service attack does not always need massive amounts of bandwith. A Slow Loris attack creates hundreds of connections to the
target service and keeps them alive by sending data as slowly as possible. This clogs up connections at the target service 
while using barely any bandwith from the attacker.

Setup a Apache server and use *slowhttptest* to target that server. Then try to configure your server to be more resilient agains this type of attack.
