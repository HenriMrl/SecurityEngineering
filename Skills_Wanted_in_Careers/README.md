# Skill Requirements and Responsibilities

"Security engineering is about building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance. As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, processes and methods needed to design, implement, and test complete systems, and to adapt existing systems as their environment evolves" -Ross Anderson [^1]

It should be noted that these systems are not limited to computer systems, but rather complete systems involving people and related equipment.

### Description

This file contains some of the more commonly spotted responsibilities, requirements and skills wanted and appreciated in security engineering jobs and related career paths. These can give you some background into the work done in security engineering, which in itself might not always be the job title.

Security engineering as a course is not too technical as the technical side and your technical skills are very cumulative throughout cyber security learning. The below list can also give insight as to why this course focuses more on the less technical side of cyber security; as all of these are very important and can easily be improved upon. Cyber security requires more people with great soft and written skills. 

This will not disclose the companies or other details about the job postings.

## Common Responsibilities

* Collaboration with engineering teams such as infrastructure, development and architecture (integrating security to development lifecycle)  
* Collaboration with customers regarding security and development costs (risk management, justifiable risk)  
* Implementation and management of policies and procedures (security posture, threat modelling)  
* Application, software, infrastructure, etc... assessment to identify vulnerabilities and weak spots (security testing)  
* Address security concerns from different teams  
* Design and implementation of technical security solutions  
* Creation of quality documentation for different skill levels  
* Auditing and testing code, teams, tools, pipelines, etc...

## Common requirements

* Background in STEM or demonstrable alternative path (usually BSc, MSc or good track record in cyber)  
* Experience in cyber security job roles (most commonly atleast 3 years, not often a hard requirement)
