# Tasks

## Task 1 
What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?
Write a short description of the actions you have done to fortify you defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes, including possible servers and accounts you have. Please keep in mind not to include any specific details, such as passwords or tokens.

Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example phishing and malware attacks. What could you improve on?

Please keep your answer concise, but at **minimum** 150 words.

## Task 2 
Personal Threat Model
A threat model is a tool used widely in security, it can be used for example to identify sensitive or vulnerable data or systems. Its goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and a likely impact of a security breach, helping companies take proper measures to mitigate and / or prevent these. A threat model can also help companies assess and prioritize its security efforts by identifying which assets are the most critical and which threats are the most probable. Overall, a threat model is a vital part of a comprehensive cyber security strategy helping organizations manage risks and breaches, and how to allocate defense budget.

In this task we are focusing solely on the cyber side of threat models as you will be creating a personal threat model to identify and assess potential threats to your assets, for example sensitive information and online accounts.

The goal of creating a personal threat model is to help you understand potential ways to analyze your own cyber behavior and how to prioritize your efforts regarding your own personal security and privacy. It is also important for cyber security students to understand the types of threats they may face and what the potential impact can be. Threat modelling is also an important skill for security professionals and doing personal threat modelling can be translatable to real world businesses.

You can find more information on [OWASP Threat modelling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling) and in [The Threat Modelling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/)

<details>
<summary>Here's few pointers for threat modelling:</summary>
<br>

- Identify your assets that could be targeted by cyber criminals

- Assess the threats and likelyhoods of them for each of your assets

- Identify vulnerabilities for example weak or repeated passwords

- Evaluate impact if an asset is compromised

- Mitigate or mitigation plan; determine what you can do now and what to do if compromised

</details>

We also recommend creating a visual representation of your threat model, diagrams and flowcharts are good for this. Discussing with your classmates can also help with any additional measures you can take to reduce your risks.

## Task 3 Company Security Policy
Pick topics from the list below to write a security policy on.
You can choose to write policies for two topics for 2 points or write one policy for 1 point.
An effort should be made to include one policy on one page. 

<details>
<summary>Topics</summary>
<br>

- Password policy
- Physical access policy
- Cloud usage/security policy
- System authentication policy
- Network perimeter security policy
- Social media security policy
- BYOD(Bring Your Own Device) policy
- General purpose information security policy

</details>

These policies are to be kept quite straight-forward and easily understandable for any employee, this includes explaining certain not well-known words, for example a VPN or a network perimeter. The second lecture "Threat Models and Security Policies" gives very good advice on how to write a sensible policy.

You should also check [this](https://csrc.nist.rip/publications/nistpubs/800-12/800-12-html/chapter5.html) for detailed advice and explanation on for example types of policies. For example chapter 5.2.2 gives good insight on what basic components are good for issue-specific policies.
You don't have to contain yourself to just text, you may include for example pictures and data-flow charts where beneficial.
