## **Task 2** Personal Threat Model

A threat model is a tool used widely in security, it can for example be user to identify sensitive data or systems. Its goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and a likely impact of a security breach, helping take proper measures to mitigate and / or prevent these. A threat model can also help companies assess and prioritize its security efforts by identifying which assets are the most critical and which threats are the most probable. Overall, a threat model is a vital part of a comprehensive cyber security strategy helping organizations manage risks and breaches, and how to allocate defense budget.

In this task we are focusing solely on the cyber side of threat models as you will be creating a personal threat model to identify and assess potential threats to your assets, for example sensitive information and online accounts.

The goal of creating a personal threat model is to help you understand potential ways to analyze your own cyber behavior and how to prioritize your efforts regarding your own personal security specifically online. It is also important for cyber security students to understand the types of threats they may face and what the potential impact can be. Threat modelling is also an important skill for security professionals and doing personal threat modelling can be translatable to real world businesses.

<summary>Here is a general guideline for personal threat modelling:</summary>

1. Identify your assets that could be targeted by cyber criminals

2. Assess the threats and likelyhoodsof them for each of your assets

3. Identify vulnerabilities for example weak or repeated passwords

4. Evaluate impact if an asset is compromised

5. Mitigate or mitigation plan; determine what you can do now and what to do if compromised

We also recommend to create a visual representation of your threat model, diagrams and flowcharts are good for this. 
Discussing with your classmates can also help with any additional measures you can take to reduce your risks.
